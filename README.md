# Spigot Plugin Library
This is a lightweight and easy to use library for fast plugin creation. I created this merely as a base for all my plugins, without the need to manually copy classes many times throughout each project.

## Features
Our library comes with a few useful features to help with the base of the plugin, we look to expand this as we move forward.

## Using the Library
You'll need to add the Jitpack repository if you already haven't.
```xml
<repository>
    <id>jitpack.io</id>
    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
</repository>
```

Once you've done this, you'll need to add the dependency like such.
   ```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.analyse.git.Official</groupId>
    <artifactId>Lib</artifactId>
    <version>77623fd72f</version>
</dependency>
   ```
